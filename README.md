Building a Data Lake with Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark

Project Overview: A data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed. This project involves setting up a data lake using Apache Hadoop as the storage layer and Apache Spark as the processing engine.

Steps Involved:
Data Ingestion: Collect large datasets from various sources (e.g., databases, APIs, files) and ingest them into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
Data Storage: Store the ingested data in HDFS, utilizing Hadoop's scalable and distributed storage capabilities.
Data Processing: Use Apache Spark to process and transform the raw data stored in HDFS. This could include operations like filtering, aggregating, and joining datasets.
Data Querying: Implement tools like Apache Hive or Apache Impala for querying the processed data using SQL-like queries.
Data Analysis: Use Spark's MLlib library to perform data analysis and machine learning on the processed data.

Skills Gained:
Understanding of Hadoop ecosystem components like HDFS, Hive, and MapReduce.
Proficiency in Spark for large-scale data processing.
Experience in building scalable data storage and processing architectures.

Use Case:
This project is particularly useful in scenarios where organizations need to store and process massive amounts of data, such as in big data analytics, machine learning, and data mining.
