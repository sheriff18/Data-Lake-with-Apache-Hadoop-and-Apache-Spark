# PNDA 3.5

PNDA release 3.5 contains a number of improvements and bug fixes. 

### Offline installation

As you will see in the PNDA guide, we've revised the provisioning process in order to support offline installation. In the PNDA repository, you will find all the scripts necessary to retrieve the required resources from Internet during provisioning.
PNDA is working now in both offline and online environments although we retain the online option for development purposes.

### RedHat support

Another new feature is the support of RedHat within PNDA so you can now build a RHEL7 PNDA base image using pnda-dib-elements on OpenStack and if you run in AWS, you can use the RedHat AMI.
In term of deployment, we've revised platform-salt in order to make it generic so that OS specific versions / name / etc... are now defined in the pillars.

### Logstash integration

The PNDA integration through logstash have been simplified and also you can now use logstash 5.3.0 instead of 2.3.4. This makes the installation and configuration much more easy, Check the Producer integration section in the [PNDA guide](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda-guide/blob/master/producer/logstash.md).

### General improvements

* Console performance
* Added Spark streaming applications


Please refer to the CHANGELOGs for a full list of fixes, changes and additions.
