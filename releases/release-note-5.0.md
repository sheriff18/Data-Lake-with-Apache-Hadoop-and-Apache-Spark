# PNDA 5.0

Code name: Mammoth Drop Bear

PNDA 5.0 is a major release containing many improvement related to the deployment.

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu is not supported any longer. We're now focusing on RedHat-like Linux distributions.

## Perimeter security for user services

PNDA and Hadoop components are now secured behind the [Knox](https://knox.apache.org/) Application Gateway, and many components have been modified to support configurable authorization.

## Deployable to VMWare

PNDA is now deployable on VMWare with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). It must still be considered as experimental feature as it as not been extensively tested.

## Name based node/service resolution

PNDA now heavily uses [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) as part of its service discovery mechanism. It opens up a lot of new possibilities that will be part of next releases.

## Revised ingest mechanics (API changes)

As part of [PDP-2](https://cwiki.pnda.io/pages/releaseview.action?pageId=1572878) Gobblin can now ingest data in protobuf and other formats. It is no longer necessary to apply an avro envelope to data.

## Apache Flink integration

As part of [PDP-3](https://cwiki.pnda.io/display/public/PNDA/PDP-3%3A+Support+for+Flink), [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) can now be used as an alternative to Spark. It allows for stream processing at event level granularity and/or very low latency with more advanced windowing and other stream processing features that Spark doesn't currently offer.

## ONAP

PNDA will be part of the next [ONAP](https://www.onap.org/) release (Code name: Casablanca).
Hence some improvements have been made related to the mirror creation. It can now be built to a Docker container. As PNDA for ONAP primary deployment target is Openstack a few updates have also been made to the Heat templates and the pnda-cli.
