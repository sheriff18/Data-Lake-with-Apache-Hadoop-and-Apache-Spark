# PNDA 3.3

PNDA release 3.3 contains a number of improvements and bug fixes.

### New Hadoop version, including Spark 1.6

We've moved forward to CDH 5.9 which includes Spark 1.6 alongside many other bugs fixes and improvements. See the [Spark release notes](http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-1-6-0.html) for more details on Spark 1.6 and refer to the [Cloudera site](https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/release-notes/topics/cdh_rn_new_in_cdh_59.html) for details of other changes.

### New build system

Based on feedback we've completely rewritten the build system for PNDA, please refer to the new [pnda](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda) repository for details.

### Robustness, scaling, upgrades & tuning

This release also introduces a number of other core improvements such as anti-affinity hints for OpenStack provisioning that ensures that HA services are properly distributed across compute nodes, better fail fast behaviour in the Salt provisioning process, improvements to support for scaling and upgrades, and more. Please refer to the Change Log below and the notes in the individual repositories for more details.

#### [platform-salt-cloud](https://github.com/pndaproject/platform-salt-cloud)

##### Changed
- Externalized build logic from Jenkins to shell script so it can be reused
- Merge kafka blackbox and whitebox & rename zookeeper_blackbox to zookeeper
 
#### [platform-tools](https://github.com/pndaproject/platform-tools)
- Unchanged in this PNDA release
 
#### [pnda](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda)
##### First version
- Top level repository and build system for PNDA
 
#### [pnda-aws-templates](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda-aws-templates)
##### Changed
- PNDA-2397: Generate the list of valid flavors dynamically. The valid values for the --branch parameter were hard coded, now they are generated based on the folder names under 'cloud-formation/'
- PNDA-2393: Update OS volume sizes for instances. Increase the standard size from 30 GB to 50 GB and for kafka from 50 GB to 150 GB.
 
##### Added
- PNDA-2142: Allow subnet IP ranges to be specified in pnda_env.yaml and used as parameters to the cloud formation templates
- PNDA-2142: Allow any parameters to be passed through to the cloud formation templates, two settings have changed their names because they are now directly passed through - AWS_IMAGE_ID > imageId and AWS_ACCESS_WHITELIST > whitelistSshAccess. Update these in pnda_env.yaml otherwise the default value in the cloud formation template will be used.
 
##### Fixed
- PNDA-2313: CLI fails fast if errors occur in individual commands. Capturing logs on the cloud instance with `command | tee` (PNDA-2266) caused the CLI to carry on if an error was returned by command, because the final exit code was set by tee.
- PNDA-2284: Use correct archive parameters to configure s3 archive credentials (the set of variables for the application package bucket were being used)
- PNDA-2420: Add missing tee to capture logs when running expand salt commands. This missing command also caused the expand operation to fail for standard flavor clusters.
 
#### [pnda-dib-elements](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda-dib-elements)

#### [pnda-guide](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda-guide)
